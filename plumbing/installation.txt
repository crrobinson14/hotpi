Oil Boiler
----------
1. Install a pair of 1" Tees (A) on the inlet/outlet of the oil boiler. On the
outlet side, this may also require a new 1" MIP to sweat (B).

2. Plumb both Tees with 1" copper pipe (C) to a pair of 1" sweat-to-PEX adapters
(D), then with 1" PEX (E) to a pair of ball valves (F).

3. Cut the 1/2" cold water supply line to the furnace at a convenient spot along
its horizontal run. Cut the pipe again in the vertical section to remove the
double-elbow transition from horizontal to vertical.

4. Assemble a short "H" bypass with a ball valve (F) and two Tees (Q). Add a
pair of ball valves (F) on the top of each leg.

5. Solder a Tee (I) onto the horizontal run, then run a vertical pipe (J) to a
1/2"-1" reducer (K) and fitting (D) into one leg of the bypass. Plumb the
vertical inlet line to the other bypass leg using a reducer (K) and fitting (D).

5. Cut the cold water inlet to the mixing valve just past the elbow below the
valve. Cap (L) the remaining section past the low-water drain valve.

6. De-solder the elbow from the cold water inlet to retain as much stub as
possible, and clean up the end (discard the elbow). Rotate the stub to a
45-degree angle and use a coupling (M) and elbow (N) to plumb this to the cold
water supply Tee.

7. Plumb PEX lines from all four ball valves over to the hot water storage tank
using tube supports (O) and bend supports (P). On the boiler lines, install a
pair of check valves (G) with fittings (H) such that the flow arrow points
TOWARD the boiler on the HOT line, and the flow arrow points AWAY from the
boiler on the COLD line.

8. For now, close all four ball valves leading to the hot water storage tank,
then open the ball valve between the Tees on the DHW coil inlet. Re-charge the
system and verify that the oil boiler correctly heats the house and hot water.

Storage Tank
------------
1. Plumb the boiler "hot" line into the outlet side of an air scoop (A) using a
pair of 1" fittings (B). Install a vent (C) and expansion tank (D) on the air
scoop.

2. On both hot and cold above the tank, add a pair of Tees (E) horizontally,
with the stubs pointing down at a convenient point to run down to the tank. Put
a ball valve (F) on the other side of each Tee. Do the same for the domestic hot
water, but use elbows instead (G).

3. Fabricate a DHW heat exchanger by cutting a 6-port manifold (H) in half and
capping (I) one cut end, then installing a pair of sweat fittings (J). Cut one
7' and two 8.5' lengths from a coil of 1/2" tubing (K) and solder these
between the two manifolds, bending the two longer lengths outward as necessary.
Suspend this coil in the tank approx. 6" below the top lip.

4. Plumb this heat exchanger through two bends and a pair of elbows (G) out
through holes in the top lip of the tank and then up to the DHW hot/cold lines.

5. Fabricate the boiler heat exchanger coils by cutting the remaining tubing
into two 18' lengths, and then the next coil into two 24' lengths and two 6'
lengths. Coil these tubes as necessary to service the four corners and two long
sides of the tank. Solder these to two more manifolds (H).

6. Plumb both manifolds similarly to the DHW setup, using sweat fittings (J) to
run the lines out to a pair of elbows (G), but add an additional elbow on the
bottom (cold) line to make the direction change. Also, insulate (L) the cold
line as much as possible. Run the "hot" line directly up to the appropriate Tee.

7. On the cold side, run the line back down again outside the tank to a Tee (E)
and then to a pair of elbows (G) to create two branches. Connect one leg to a
zone valve (M) using a pair of fittings (B), with the flow direction pointing
DOWN. Connect the other leg to a circulator (N) using a pair of flanges (O)
and fittings (B).

8. Connect both branches down to the stubs of a pair of Tees (E). Connect these
Tees together, then run one line to a ball valve (F) low point drain, and the
other through an elbow (G) and up to the hot-line Tee.

9. Use 1/2" CPVC tubing plus Tee and Elbow fittings to build a support framework
for the heat exchangers. Then build two 1" CPVC stubs with elbows through the
top lip of the tank. One stub should go nearly to the bottom of the tank
(intake) while the other should end as close to the top of the tank as possible.

10. Build a thermostat dip tube from 1/2" CPVC by capping one end and using an
elbow on the other. Install two temperature sensors in the tube, one near the
top and the other near the bottom, with heat-shrink on the connections to
prevent them from shorting one another out. Fill the tube with mineral oil.

11. Seal all tank holes with silicone. Slowly charge each heat exchanger and
check carefully for leaks. Fix any leaks, using compressed air to blow out the
lines if necessary. Then fill the tank and check the tank itself for leaks. Once
everything is ready to go, close back off the oil burner heat lines but leave
the DHW lines open.

Wood Boiler
-----------
1. Plumb the hot-side line above the wood boiler and into a Tee (A) with the
stub pointing to the right. Connect the bottom of the Tee into the boiler via
a threaded fitting (B). Stub the Tee over to the right side of the boiler,
through an elbow, and down to a zone valve (D) via a pair of fittings (B).
The flow direction on the zone valve should point down.

2. Plumb the cold-side line across to the right side of the wood boiler and
down nearly (6") to the floor, into the stub of a Tee (A). Connect the right
side of the Tee to a ball valve (E) low point drain. Connect the left side to
the right side of another Tee (A). The stub of this Tee should connect to the
zone valve from Step 1 above.

3. Connect the next leg of the tees into an elbow and up into a circulator (F)
via a flange (G) and a pair of fittings (B). Support the circulator with a block
of wood.

4. Connect the top of the circulator through a pair of elbows (C) around the
back of the wood boiler and into a Tee (A) and a final elbow (C) and into the
inlets of the boiler via a pair of fittings (B).

5. Install a relief valve on a short iron pipe stub in the pressure-relief hole
on top of the boiler.

6. Connect the boiler's flue as required.

7. Fill the boiler with water and check for leaks in the entire system. Then
test fire the boiler with a SMALL load of wood with a thermometer in the
temperature well in the top of the water jacket. If the temperature reaches an
unacceptable level, force the circulator to turn on and dump heat into the water
tank.
