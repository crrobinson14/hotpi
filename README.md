hotpi
=====

HotPi is a Raspberry-Pi based heating control system. It is
designed to manage wood boilers, solar arrays, and other
alternative energy sources, although it is generic enough
that it could be programmed to control near any heating
and/or cooling system.

HotPi is Open Source Hardware (OSHW). That means it is not
a product - you must build it yourself, and you are solely
liable for its installation and programming. Included in
this project are circuit schematics, PCB layouts (with
Gerber files) for producing the boards, components lists,
documentation, and sample software.
