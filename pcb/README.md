hotpi PCB
=========

This is HotPi's PCB control board. The PCB serves as a bridge between the
Raspberry Pi main computer and the Teensy++ I/O daughter board, as well as all
of the terminal blocks for I/O.

These board files are in DipTrace format. DipTrace is an excellent schematic/PCB
design tool with a free version for demo purposes. But you don't need to use it
to view these files - Gerbers are also included here.

TODO: Make a PDF of the schematic.
